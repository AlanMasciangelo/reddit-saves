# Reddit saves

A script for exporting all your saved Reddit posts to a markdown table. `./main.py` contains comments documenting usage. 

If you want to see all my programming related saved posts you can view them [here](https://alanmasciangelo.github.io/posts/Saved-Reddit-posts).

## output

The script outputs a file `saved_posts.md` that looks like this:
